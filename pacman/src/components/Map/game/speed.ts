 * through the tunnel, frightened ghosts are slow, and Blinky becomes "Cruise
 * Elroy" near the end.
 *  - `pacman` / `pacmanFright`: Pac-Man normally / while ghosts are frightened;
 *    both scaled by `PACMAN_BOOST` before use, so these stay the arcade's values.
 *  - `ghost`: any ghost on the open maze (also while leaving the house).
 *  - `tunnel`: a ghost within `TUNNEL_REACH` of a teleport mouth; Pac-Man is
 *    unaffected. Overrides everything but `eyes`.
 *  - `fright`: a frightened (edible) ghost. `eyes`: an eaten ghost racing home.
 *  - `elroy`: `[dotsLeft, speed]` pairs, most urgent first — Blinky's speed once
 *    at most that many dots remain, suspended after a death until Clyde is out.
 *  - `stall`: frames Pac-Man stops for per pellet / power pellet. This is what
 *    turns his 80% into the Dossier's "~71% on dots".
