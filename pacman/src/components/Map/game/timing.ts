/**
 * Ticks per second, and the milliseconds per tick that follow from it.
 *
 * `SEC` is the primary constant, not derived: the arcade tables are in seconds
 * and the sim counts in ticks, so every duration below is `n * SEC`. Deriving it
 * back out of `TICK_MS` would give 59.999... and leave every one of those
 * durations a hair under a whole number of ticks, which countdowns compared
 * against 0 then never land on exactly.
 *
 * One tick is one frame, not one tile: every mover banks a fraction of a tile
 * per tick and steps once a whole tile is banked (see `speed.ts`). Running the
 * sim at frame rate is what lets Pac-Man, ghosts, tunnels and Elroy all move at
 * different speeds on a tile grid without jitter.
