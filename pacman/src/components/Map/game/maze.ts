 * way he was headed. `want` is taken whenever it is a real direction and `step`
 * finds that way open — a straight reversal included, as on the cabinet, where a
 * 180 is legal anywhere and is how you break off a chase. Anything else carries
 * on along `dir`, staying put if that's a wall. A `want` of [0, 0] means
 * "nothing asked for" (no key yet, or the press aged out — see TURN_BUFFER) and
 * falls through to the same carry-on.
 *
 * Only ever called on a tile boundary, so a reversal costs a tile of travel like
 * any other turn rather than flipping him mid-step.
