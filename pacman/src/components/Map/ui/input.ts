 * jingle; ticking starts when it ends.
 *
 * Input is modelled on the cabinet's joystick rather than on keystrokes: a held
 * key is a held stick, asking for that turn at every corner until let go, and a
 * tap is a flick the sim honours for `TURN_BUFFER` ticks — which is what lets a
 * player turn a corner without hitting the exact frame. `held` keeps the keys
 * still down, oldest first, so the newest one wins.
 *
 * A fixed-step accumulator over `requestAnimationFrame` rather than
 * `setInterval`, because browsers round timer delays to whole milliseconds
 * (16.67 -> 16, i.e. 4% fast) and throttle them in hidden tabs; frames track the
 * display clock exactly and simply stop while the tab is hidden.
